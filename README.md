# GumuslukCircir

[This](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/155cOa_UTWLd2UxtfXnM8tfmujoJI3o9H?usp=sharing) notebook was born out of boredom and curiosity during my short vacation in Gumusluk, Bodrum.
Several cicadas were around the house of my friend who hosted a group of us for a week, who were quite chatty (both us and the cicadas).

One morning, I was reading on the balcony, and was accompanied by a few of these loud high-chitin friends. I decided to ignore their privacy and recorded them without their consent.
